What is WSGI and what is its purpose?

WSGI stands for Web Server Gateway Interface, 
and it is a specification that defines how 
web servers and web applications can communicate 
with each other. Its purpose is to allow web servers 
and web applications to be developed separately,
and to make it easier to switch between different
web servers or different web frameworks.
