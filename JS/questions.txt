Closure: A closure is a function that remembers its lexical environment (the variables that were in scope when it was created).
function outer() {
  let count = 0;
  return function inner() {
    count++;
    console.log(count);
  };
}

const counter = outer();
counter(); // 1
counter(); // 2


Cross-Origin Requests (CORS)
CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a mechanism that allows resources from one origin to be requested from another origin. The server must include appropriate CORS headers to allow these requests.
Example:
fetch('https://api.example.com', {
  headers: {
    'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*'
  }
});
If CORS is not properly configured on the server, the browser will block the request due to security reasons.
