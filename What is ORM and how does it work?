 What is ORM and how does it work?
 
A: ORM stands for Object-Relational Mapping.
It is a programming technique that allows developers
to work with a database using an object-oriented
programming language like Python, rather than writing 
SQL queries directly. An ORM maps the tables in a database
to classes in the programming language, and allows developers
to create, read, update, and delete records using simple method 
calls on those classes. The ORM handles the translation of those method
calls into SQL queries and executes them against the database.
