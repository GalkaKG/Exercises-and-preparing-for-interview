# Difference Between Correlation and Causation

- Correlation: A statistical measure that describes the extent to which two variables change together. 
If two variables are correlated, it means that as one variable changes, the other tends to change in a specific way. 
However, correlation does not imply that one variable causes the other to change.

- Causation: Indicates that one event is the result of the occurrence of the other event; i.e., there is a cause-and-effect relationship. 
Establishing causation requires more rigorous testing, often through controlled experiments or longitudinal studies.

1. Data Collection: Gather historical trading data, including price, volume, and other relevant indicators.

2. Data Cleaning: Handle missing data, remove outliers, and ensure data quality.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

  - Trend Analysis: Identify long-term trends in price movements.

  - Seasonality: Check for recurring patterns at specific intervals.

  - Volatility Analysis: Measure the rate at which the price of a security increases or decreases.

4. Technical Indicators: Use indicators like Moving Averages, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, etc., to identify potential buy/sell signals.

5. Pattern Recognition: Identify chart patterns such as head and shoulders, double tops/bottoms, etc.

6. Machine Learning Models: Build predictive models to forecast future price movements based on historical data.

7. Backtesting: Test your strategies on historical data to evaluate their effectiveness.

8. Risk Management: Implement risk management strategies to mitigate potential losses.
