What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous programming in Python?

Synchronous programming in Python is when code is executed one line at a time, 
in order. Asynchronous programming, on the other hand, allows for code to be 
executed out of order, which can make it more efficient and faster.
Asyncio is a Python module that allows you to write asynchronous code.
