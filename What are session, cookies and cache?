In Django, a session is a mechanism that allows you to store and retrieve arbitrary data on a per-site-visitor basis.
It stores data on the server side and abstracts the sending and receiving of cookies. 
This enables you to maintain user-specific data across multiple HTTP requests, 
making it useful for features like user authentication, shopping carts, and more.
Django handles session management using a session framework that's built into the framework itself.

In Django, cookies are small pieces of data that are sent from a web server to a user's web browser and then stored locally.
They are used to store information about the user's interaction with the website, such as session IDs, user preferences, and other data. 
Cookies in Django can be managed using the built-in HttpResponse.set_cookie() method to set cookies and the request.COOKIES dictionary to access cookies in the user's request. 
Cookies are commonly used for maintaining user sessions and personalizing user experiences on websites.

In Django, caching refers to the process of storing frequently accessed data in a temporary storage location, known as a cache, to improve the performance and response time of web applications.
Caching helps avoid the need to recreate or fetch the same data repeatedly from the original source, such as a database, which can be time-consuming and resource-intensive.
Django provides a robust caching framework that supports various caching backends, such as in-memory caching, file-based caching, and even external solutions like Memcached and Redis. 
Developers can use decorators and middleware provided by Django to selectively cache views, templates, and data, improving the efficiency of their applications.
By caching certain parts of a website, developers can significantly reduce the load on databases and speed up the rendering of pages, resulting in a better user experience.
