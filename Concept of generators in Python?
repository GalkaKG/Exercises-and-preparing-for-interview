Can you explain the concept of generators in Python?

Answer: Generators are a type of iterable, like lists 
or tuples, but unlike those objects, they do not store
their contents in memory. Instead, they generate their
values on the fly, using a special type of function called
a generator function. This makes generators very 
memory-efficient, especially for large data sets.
