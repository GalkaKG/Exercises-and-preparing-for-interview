In React, useState works asynchronously to maintain the efficiency and performance of the user interface. Here’s what that means and why it’s designed this way:
What is useState?
useState is a React hook that allows you to add state to functional components. When you call setState (the state update function), React updates the component's state and re-renders the UI to reflect the new data.

const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

function increment() {
    setCount(count + 1); // Updates the state
}

Why is setState asynchronous in React?
a) Optimizing Re-renders
React uses a virtual DOM and works to minimize unnecessary re-renders. If setState were synchronous, the UI would update immediately with every state change, potentially causing redundant updates.

With asynchronous execution, React batches all setState calls and performs a single re-render. The final value will be count + 3, which enhances performance.

b) Sequential UI Updates
React prioritizes state updates based on their importance. This ensures that critical changes affecting the UI are processed first, even if multiple setState calls are made.

c) React’s Reconciliation Process
React uses a reconciliation process to compare the old and new virtual DOM. This requires state updates to be asynchronous so all changes can be batched together before being applied to the real DOM.

What are the implications of this?
a) setState doesn’t take effect immediately
When you call setState, the state change is not reflected right away. This means if you try to access the updated state immediately after calling setState, you’ll still get the old value.

const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

function handleClick() {
    setCount(count + 1);
    console.log(count); // Logs the old value (0), not the updated value (1)
}

b) Solution: Use useEffect or the functional version of setState
If you need to work with the most up-to-date state after a change, you can:

Use useEffect – React to state changes after they occur.
Use the functional version of setState – This accepts the current state as an argument.
Example with useEffect:
useEffect(() => {
    console.log(count); // Executes after `count` changes
}, [count]);
Example with functional setState:
setCount((prevCount) => prevCount + 1);

React makes useState asynchronous because:

- It improves performance by batching updates.
- It reduces unnecessary re-renders.
- It allows for better management of changes through prioritization.
